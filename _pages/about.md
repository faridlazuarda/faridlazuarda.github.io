I am a researcher in the NLP Department at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), Abu Dhabi with [Dr. Alham Fikri Aji](https://afaji.github.io/). My work focuses on efficient learning, multilinguality, and multicultural adaptation for Large Language Models (LLMs). I am collaborating with [Prof. Monojit Choudhury](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WR1ImCMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) to systematically survey and evaluate current research on cultural aspects in LLMs. Additionally, during my internship at [UKP Lab, TU Darmstadt](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp), I am working with [Prof. Iryna Gurevych](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/head_ukp/index.en.jsp) on Cultural Value Adaptation using Parameter-Efficient Modules in LLMs.

In 2023, I graduated cum laude and as the youngest graduate with a Master's in [Intelligent Systems](https://stei.itb.ac.id/program-pasca-sarjana/magister-informatika/) from Institut Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia. I collaborated with [Dr. Ayu Purwarianti](https://www.itb.ac.id/staf/profil/ayu-purwarianti), [Genta Indra Winata](https://gentawinata.com/), and [Samuel Cahyawijaya](https://samuelcahyawijaya.github.io/) on [unseen languages generalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06034v2). I graduated from Institut Teknologi Bandung with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2022. My [undergraduate thesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.12405) on studying language models' code-mixing robustness in Indonesian local languages was published in the SUMEval Workshop at AACL 2022 and covered by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/stories/bloombergs-ai-engineering-group-publishes-4-nlp-research-papers-at-aacl-ijcnlp-2022/).

<!-- I will join the [ILCC at the University of Edinburgh](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) this fall! -->
