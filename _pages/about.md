I’m an incoming NLP PhD student at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), advised by [Edoardo Maria Ponti](https://ducdauge.github.io/) and [Alexandra Birch](https://people.inf.ed.ac.uk/Alexandra_Birch-Mayne.html). I’m part of the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC)](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) and the [Edinburgh NLP Group](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/).

My research asks a big question: how can we make language models better reasoners? That means figuring out how to train them with the right data, teaching them to leverage inference-time compute more wisely, and pushing them to work well across many languages. I care about efficiency, but even more about making systems that actually serve diverse communities.

Before Edinburgh, I was a Research Assistant at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) in Abu Dhabi and a visiting researcher at the [UKP Lab, TU Darmstadt](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp), where I worked on multilingual, multicultural, and parameter-efficient NLP—topics I still enjoy discussing!

I know how much research success can depend on access and opportunity. If you’re from an underrepresented group and think a conversation might help, feel free to reach out by [email](mailto:farid.adilazuarda@mbzuai.ac.ae).
